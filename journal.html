<p id="title"> MY JOURNAL</p> 

<p>Entry 1: I had alot of help making my journal because unourtuanetly I missed a week an a half of class but like trust I guess.I found it really intersting how terminal works and how we make our own websites and code our own homepages.  </p>                   																																		
<p>Entry 2: I still dont have a gif but im starting to catch up, I didnt have much progress but on the bright side nobody did. Litterally not much of anything has happened over the week so thats it I guess.</p>

<p> Entry 3: I cought up fully and made my animation, Even though I mised class, I still think I got evreything we learned then down. For my next project im going to make a color randomizer.
